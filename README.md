# SWEP-GmodTool
Create your own Gmod weapon with this tool

Put this file in your addon garry's mod file like this (Your path probably won't be the same, find yours):
  C:\GameMod\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons
  
 Then inside the SWEP_GmodTool file, there is a window.exe, launch it.
 
 Now feel free to create your weapon
